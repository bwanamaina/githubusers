# GitHub User Profiles

React app using [github users api](https://api.github.com/users/) to search users.

I haven't used any state management package since it has only two components.

# Usage

```
# Install dependencies
yarn install
```

```
# Run app
yarn start
```

```
# Run unit tests
yarn test
```

```
# Run integration test
yarn cypress
```
